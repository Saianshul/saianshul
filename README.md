## About Me

I am a student at UC San Diego pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for building software that is efficient, scalable, user-friendly, and most importantly, impactful.

As a creative and perseverant problem solver, I am dedicated to using technology to build tangible solutions for real-world challenges. Utilizing the skills that I have developed from projects and courses, I am eager to dive deep into a problem's core to engineer resilient software that meets real-world demands and delivers lasting value.

I am proficient in languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Java, and I have a mastery of core CS skills such as data structures and algorithms and object-oriented programming/design. I excel in collaborative environments, using Git to streamline teamwork and manage complex projects. My biggest project, [Study Link](https://github.com/acmucsd-projects/fa2024-hack-team-3), is a MERN Stack web application I helped develop in a team of six for students to connect and form study groups with other students. This project gave me hands-on experience in shipping user-centered features and collaborating within an agile team to transform a concept into a fully functional product.

Currently, I am seeking a Software Engineering Internship for Summer 2026 where I can contribute to solving real-world problems and learn from experienced mentors.
